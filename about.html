  <h1>About Us!</h1>
  <p><b>Pawsitivity is a community that hopes to serve as a home and shelter for all pets & animals all over the world.</p>
<h5>Here at Pawsitivity, we plan on preserving all YOUR precious pets and giving them a temporary home until you're ready to join the paw-rty and provide them with your own version
of a house turned into a home. </b></h5>

<b><h2><u>SINCE 1978</u></h2></b>
<h3>We're very Proud to announce that our community has been growing rapidly since 1978. At first, we started off small, just a local pet store in Positano, Italy - Southern Italy to be specific!
  Victoriously, our business grew rapidly during only its first year in the market. And then, after a few years of nurturing and expanding our Pet-tastic family,
  we were able to make it to the <strong>"Top 10 Best Pet Stores in the World"</strong> by 1981!</h2>
  <h2><u>FOUNDERS</u></h2>
<h3>Pawsitivity was first founded by the owners Mariam Hesham and Malak Radwan back in the day. They both had an undying love for animals and are still very seemlessly keeping up with it!
The two started a Pet-Sitting business <i>ONLY A YEAR</i> before they decided to go bigger. Of course they'd already thought of starting their own store/company but the
the key turning point for them that really gave them the push to do it much sooner than they'd anticipated was on one of the days while they were each walking a pair of dogs, they passed by a damp, grey alleyway and discovered
a small group of different species of animals all sorted together beneath a tiny old umbrella.. The two took it upon themselves to rescue these helpless creatures and thankfully each had their own
backyard at home, This was where they made sure the animals were safe and healthy. They later made an official page for their business and then began the real magic. They worked hard
to promote their work and to make sure that the animals were still the stars of the show. They've been getting new customers every day since!</h3>
